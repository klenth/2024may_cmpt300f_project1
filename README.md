# Project 1
## Lambdas and writing Scala code

This project consists of three parts:
1. [Java] Write some code in a functional style using streams
2. [Scala] Implement some case classes, then do some array manipulations
3. [Scala] Practice with lambdas

You can find directions for each part in the source files. If you need more guidance,
drop me a DM! (In particular, if you're having trouble getting Scala code to run, let
me know and we can take a look at it.)

### Requirements
- For 1 point: fully complete two out of three of the parts
- For 2 points: fully complete all three parts

## Submission
Submit this project by pushing to your GitHub Classroom repository for this assignment.
(We will practice this in class on Tuesday.) If you're having issues with this, let me
know; I can be flexible!
